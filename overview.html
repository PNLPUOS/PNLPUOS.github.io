  <h3>Foreword</h3>
  This project began as a cooperative study project between students at the University of Osnabr√ºck and
  <a href='https://deepsight.de/en/'>deepsight GmbH.</a>
  The goals of the project were to implement a natural language processing pipeline optimized to the analysis of short,
  open comments such as those found in employee survey data. It is common to include open-response questions with employee surveys
  as these questions provide additional incentive for employees to express their satisfaction relevant to topics
  of concern which may not be known to the surveying department. However, these questions pose an additional challenge
  to analysis given that the responses are necessarily unstructured. In this project, we develop an end-to-end solution
  for the analysis of short texts via document clustering and sentiment analysis of clustered documents.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Approach</h3>
  To provide focused reporting on employee satisfaction relevant to topics of recurrent interest, we employ a
  document clustering approach to identify topics of interest, and then analyse the sentiment distribution within
  each topic via sentiment classification. Document clustering is a common NLP task for information retrieval and
  text classification, and as such there exist a variety of available algorithms and tuning methods for achieving
  interpretable clusters of documents. [1] Further information on our document clustering approach can be found
  in the <a href="https://pnlpuos.github.io/topic-modeling">Topic Modeling</a> section of this
  report.
<p>
  Sentiment classification is a common NLP task which poses sufficient difficulty given our domain and the brevity
  of comments for which we aim to identify sentiment. Given these challenges, approaches such as keyword identification
  do not produce consistently satisfactory results. In the end, our approach to sentiment classification involves a
  custom-trained recursive neural network model trained on twitter data. Further information on our sentiment classification
  approach can be found in the <a href="https://pnlpuos.github.io/sentiment-analysis">Sentiment Analysis</a>
  section of this report.
</p>
<p>
  Our document clustering and sentiment analysis methods depend on the features extracted from pretrained word embeddings, which
  are sensitive to spelling errors and unnecessary characters. Because of this, we employ several preprocessing stages to
  render the original data, while also filtering for undesired tokens such as stop words and highly-frequent words. Further
  information on the preprocessing methods we employ can be found in the <a href="https://pnlpuos.github.io/data-preparation">Data Preparation</a>
  section of this report.

  <h3>Organization</h3>
  The project was organized into two main phases. The first phase was primarily exploratory, wherein we employed a modified agile methodology
  to manage the initial testing of available approaches. Further information on the exact methods employed can be found in the presentation 'A Scrum Inspired
  Approach for Agile Project Management' listed below. This initial exploratory phase was
  important to identify unsuccessful approaches and refine the end goals of the project before beginning development proper.
  During the second phase, we implemented, optimized, and integrated the various steps of the aforementioned pipeline. During this phase,
  the project group was reorganized into three sub-groups each responsible for one of the three main
  sections of the analysis pipeline represented in this report. Through a series of sub-group-led workshops, the project group
  coordinated on the continued development and integration of the pipeline components, culminating in the finished deliverable.
  Further information on sub-group presentations can be found below.

  <h3>Pitfalls</h3>
  As mentioned, the exploratory project phase was important to identify approaches which proved unsuccessful for our dataset
  or otherwise infeasible given computational resource constraints or other limitations. For example, given that the document
  clustering approach depends on the quality of pretrained word embeddings it was critical to evaluate the available word
  embedding models before continuing with the approach. We tested several pretrained embeddings computed via several algorithms,
  including those from Word2Vec and FastText. [2, 3] Further information on the embeddings tested and the final model employed can
  be found in the <a href="https://pnlpuos.github.io/topic-modeling">Topic Modeling</a> section of the report.
  Likewise, we first implemented a custom-trained transformer model for sentiment classification, but found this approach to be
  too computationally costly. Finally, for spell correction we originally implemented a wrapper for the string-matching algorithm
  developed by <a href='https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html'>Peter Norvig</a>, but found this approach to be
  too destructive, leading us to develop a proprietary spell correction
  algorithm based on pretrained word embeddings. Additional information on the outcome of successful methods is found in the
  <a href="https://pnlpuos.github.io/outcome">Outcome and Reflection</a> section of this report.
